        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          Hello! I'm Endi Suwandi, an Informatics Engineering student at Sebelas
          April University, Sumedang, and a continuously growing Fullstack Web
          Developer. I built this website as part of my journey in technology—a
          space where I constantly learn, innovate, and solidify my identity as
          a competent, honest, and professional individual.
          <br /><br />
          I don't just write code; I build solutions. In the midst of today's
          dynamic technology landscape, I believe that integrity, consistency,
          and dedication are the core values that define a true developer.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Why This Website?</strong><br />
          🎯 <strong>A Transparent Digital Portfolio</strong><br />
          All projects, from frontend to backend, are showcased
          honestly—complete with the technologies used, challenges faced, and
          lessons learned.
          <br /><br />
          💡 <strong>Building an Authentic Personal Brand</strong><br />
          I want to be known not just for my skills in building web
          applications, but also for my character, work ethic, and consistent
          passion for learning.
          <br /><br />
          🚀 <strong>Preparing for a Career with a Strong Foundation</strong
          ><br />
          My career is built on principles of trust, solid technical abilities,
          and a long-term commitment to continuous growth within the tech
          industry.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Who Might Be Interested?</strong><br />
          👨‍🏫 <strong>Lecturers & Mentors</strong> – Those who value honesty and
          want to see the real progress of a dedicated student.<br />
          🧑‍💻 <strong>Fellow IT Students & Aspiring Developers</strong> – Those
          who want to grow together and see that becoming a Fullstack Developer
          is an achievable goal.<br />
          📂 <strong>Companies & Recruiters</strong> – Those searching for young
          talent with a broad technical skillset and a dependable character.<br />
          🤝 <strong>Anyone Who Values the Process</strong> – Because I believe
          the best results can only be achieved through a process that is
          honest, consistent, and passionate.
