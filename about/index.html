          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Endi Suwandi, an Informatics Engineering student at
            Sebelas April University, Sumedang, and a continuously growing
            Fullstack Web Developer. I built this website as part of my journey
            in technology—a space where I constantly learn, innovate, and
            solidify my identity as a competent, honest, and professional
            individual.
            <br /><br />
            I don't just write code; I build solutions. In the midst of today's
            dynamic technology landscape, I believe that integrity, consistency,
            and dedication are the core values that define a true developer.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Why This Website?</strong><br />

            🎯 <strong>A Transparent Digital Portfolio</strong><br />
            All projects, from frontend to backend, are showcased
            honestly—complete with the technologies used, challenges faced, and
            lessons learned.
            <br /><br />
            💡 <strong>Building an Authentic Personal Brand</strong><br />
            I want to be known not just for my skills in building web
            applications, but also for my character, work ethic, and consistent
            passion for learning.
            <br /><br />
            🚀 <strong>Preparing for a Career with a Strong Foundation</strong
            ><br />
            My career is built on principles of trust, solid technical
            abilities, and a long-term commitment to continuous growth within
            the tech industry.
